# CNN-Architectures-Comparative-Study
This project analyzes key CNN architectures—AlexNet, LeNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet—using the soybean disease dataset. By implementing and evaluating these models, the study assesses their effectiveness in identifying and classifying soybean diseases, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses for agricultural disease diagnosis.
